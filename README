Continous beams

Simplified application to compute stresses and deformation of a mono-section continous beam loaded with constant trasversal loads, one per span.
Will eventually evolte into a full-fledged truss application targeting mobile devices.

Windows note: remember to add -mstackrealign when crosscompilig. See http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/WrongStackAlignment.html
